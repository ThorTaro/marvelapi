Marvel comic API training with Moya Swift

----Sorry, my English is not good...----
This project is my iOS programming training with Moya Swift and Marvel comic API.

How to use this app
1. Input the character name on the search bar and tap search button.

2. If success, it shows the result(character name and character image), else it shows error state(not found or error).

3. Tap the character image, it shows the full character image , name , and description.


What you need to run this app
1. Marvel comic API(private API key and public API key)

2. Home background image(Because of copyright, home image is deleted on this project. 
To run this project, you add a background image.)


Thank you.
